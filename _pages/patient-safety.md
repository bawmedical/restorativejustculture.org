## Patient Safety – Just what does this mean for Restorative Just Cultures

Patient safety is a combination of culture, behaviours and underlying conditions – it is fundamentally about the way we relate to and work with each other. Patient Safety as a concept is not new, but re -thinking patient safety and how we can underpin our processes, systems, polices and regulatory frameworks with restorative principles and practices is one of the ways we can re-think patient safety which provides the best support for our patients and our workforce.

Re-thinking patient safety from restorative approaches is organically growing and evolving as we navigate this field together, however in keeping with our ethos of evidenced based practice and teaching, Mersey Care NHS FT would like to share their practice so far in underpinning patient safety with restorative practices.

If you and your Trust are also adapting your patient safety practices, policies and frameworks and you would like to share this with the community then head over to our community forum discussion boards where you can start or add to an existing conversation or contact us and would be happy to share this for you.

## Re-thinking Patient Safety in Action - Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust

First lets hear from Dr Panchu Xavier, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, Deputy Medical Director and Director of Patient Safety at Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust.

In this video Panchu discusses and explains the different ways in which we can learn from incidents and the important role that psychological safety plays in this learning. In particular Panchu will share key points regarding patient safety, quality and a restorative just culture such as:

* Shifting the approach of the serious incident framework away from individuals and root cause analysis to exploring and understanding systemic issues and how this approach can improve outcomes.

* The ways in which Mersey Care has developed its new patient safety strategy underpinned by the principles of a restorative just culture resulting in a 35% reduction in formal complaints in the last 12-18 months.

* The focus on systems as opposed to the person as a new way of learning from incidents and adverse events that take place.

* The role that psychological safety plays in learning from serious incidents in enabling staff to speak up, so the learning can take place.

## Case Study - Our Just and Learning Culture: application to Patient safety and innovation

Implementing restorative principles and practices is the centre of much effort and debate in the NHS. How to achieve this significant and transformative change while meeting critical indicators is something we are all learning. Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust has been working on this with their teams from mental health services, organisational effectiveness and patient safety to see how this can be done.
