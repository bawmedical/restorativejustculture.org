# The Civility and Respect Programme by NHS England and Improvement

**Insert picture of first slide Supporting Our Staff**

Civility and Respect has huge implications for the implementation and success of a restorative just culture in any setting. We believe that is should be at the centre of all efforts to be restorative and at the core of all our policies and processes, particularly when these are being re-designed and/or reviewed to support and facilitate restorative processes.

Collectively, we must ensure staff feel valued, supported and empowered to carry out their work. This needs to be role modelled throughout teams and organisations. Leaders at all levels, therefore, have an integral role to play in exhibiting behaviours and demonstrating values that lead to a culture of civility and respect.

We are the NHS: People Plan 2020/21 – action for us all recognised this need and committed to providing organisations with the NHS Civility and Respect Toolkit to help tackle bullying and harassment and to create a civil and respectful workplace culture.

The Civility and Respect Framework by NHS England and NHS Improvement provides a practical overview to thinking and action using the AIM approach of:

* **analyse**: understand the issues

* **intervene**: take action to address the issues

* **measure**: evaluate the impact of interventions

This makes underlying issues easier to analyse, plan for and intervene. Using the AIM model, the framework highlights the importance of data to understand and benchmark employee experience and the importance of engaging with employees to understand their experience, what the culture feels like, how the process makes them feel and what support they need.

There are four central themes to the NHS Civility and Respect framework which are:

* Theme 1: Data and Analysis

* Theme 2: Policy and Process

* Theme 3: Staff Management and Support

* Theme 4: Just and Restorative Culture

## Theme 1 Data and Analysis

This theme explores and explains the ways in which data and analysis is about accessing, analysing, understanding and triangulating data. From a strategic point of view, good data and data analysis ensure that board, management and human resources (HR) have the knowledge they need to better understand issues and make them more visible, reinforcing organisational and individual accountability for action.  You should check this section to see examples of the types and range of data that can be used and the ways in which you can analyse and interpret this.
## Theme 2 Policy and Process

This theme explains the importance of reviewing our current policy position and establishing an approach and focus that enables providers to work in the space beyond policies and processes. Reviewing the balance between the formal and informal aspects of Dignity at Work, agreeing a strategic approach to conflict in the workplace and looking at how to move towards supporting staff in the restoration of relationships (preferably before they get

fixed in a retribution frame of mind). This theme is therefore about getting the policy balance right and supporting HR and management to develop and refine the necessary skills and competencies. You should check this section to see examples of the essential elements that should make up your restorative policies and the desired skills competencies to enable your people to develop and create policies that support the workforce.

## Theme 3 Staff Management and Support

This theme explains the ways in which staff and management support builds on the

restorative approach by focusing on:

* What is available informally to support staff and managers experiencing uncivil and bullying behaviours

* Support during the formal processes

* Support for managers handling the process at both informal and formal levels.

* The health and wellbeing of all staff, recognising how incivility and bullying can affect the health of everyone involved.

You should check this section for examples of questions that will help you to identity the extent to which your organisation is set up to support their employees and how this can help to what extent they support their employees to challenge incivility and disrespect in the workplace. Critically it also suggest they identify the practical actions that can be taken by managers to enable them to shape cultures of civility and respect and the link this has to the health and wellbeing of our workforce.

## Theme 4 Just and Restorative Culture

This theme discusses the ways in which a just and restorative culture concentrates on the

culture and leadership elements of organisations and how they can support organisations to grow compassion in the workplace, modelled by leaders. It also emphasises working with partners such as local union representatives, Freedom to Speak Up Guardians, employee engagement leads and health and wellbeing leads. You should check this section to understand the essential elements of compassionate leadership, systems elements thar trigger inappropriate behaviours and the learning from past behaviours and ways of doing things that enables restoration.

# Civility and Respect at Mersey Care NHS FT

Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust prides itself on being one of the first NHS organisations to introduce a Restorative Just and Learning Culture. For them, this means an environment where they put equal emphasis on accountability and learning when something has not gone as planned. So we ask, what happened? Not, who is to blame?

As part of their work, they introduced a Civility and Respect workstream group who were asked to develop a framework that aligned to Trust values and fostered and supported civility in practice.

In the following video you can watch Lois Newitt HR Strategic Lead For Community and Local Divisions at Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust discuss the important work within Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust regarding the role of civility and respect in restorative practices.

**Insert video here**

In this video, Lois discusses the actions of Mersey Care regarding civility and respect and restorative just cultures such as creating and supporting respect and civility work streams, the development of a comprehensive training plan and triangulating data sources to measure and evaluate the impact of these. Lois also discusses the ‘Respect and Civility Jigsaw’ and the ‘Respect and Civility Booklet’ that are just some of the tools and frameworks that Mersey Care have developed as a way of empowering staff to challenge miscommunication, reduce hurt and always choose civility and respect and a positive culture.

This also includes a discussion around the Social Partnership Forum's Call to Action, which Executive Director of Workforce Amanda Oates and Staff Side's Chris Sullivan has signed, pledging to choose Respect, Civility and adopt a positive culture.

## The Mersey Care NHS Civility and Respect Jigsaw

Designed by the civility and respect working group at Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, the civility and respect jigsaw is a working tool that is designed to empower staff to challenge miscommunication, reduce hurt and always choose civility and a positive culture. The respect and civility jigsaw describes both positive and negative behaviours that we may have experienced, witnessed, or demonstrated ourselves towards others. You can download the puzzle and guide [here](../assets/documents/Mersey%20Care%20-%20Respect%20and%20civility%2015_9_21.pdf)

**INSERT PICTURE OF THE JIGSAW HERE**

{% include video id="WQt3YnFBLwQ" provider="youtube" %}

The green side of the jigsaw describes what respectful and civil behaviour looks like; the red side describes what disrespectful and uncivil behaviour looks like. The following is a suggestion for how you can use this with your teams:

* Point out the questions in the middle of each side... Do you? Have you seen? Have you experienced?

* Ask for views from the team, you can support discussion with open questions or your own observations “I’ve noticed... I feel that...”

* Are we all green as a team? Is this how we do things here?

* How well do we practice the behaviours on the green side of the jigsaw?

* Are there any areas we could get better at as a team? What can we do more of to be great at this?

* How consistent are we at practicing the behaviours in the green zone?

* Which areas on the red side have people witnessed or experienced, even as a one off?

* How easy is it to challenge negative behaviours?

* What do we need to do more of or less of to reduce the behaviours on the red side of the jigsaw?

* How could we ensure that we flourish as a ‘green’ team?

* What are your ideas for how we use this tool to regularly check in?

As a team, consider each of the green jigsaw pieces and agree some practical ways that the team can implement these. These could be used to develop a team charter or team operating principles or team ground rules.

## Civility and Respect Reflective Questions

If you are interested in applying the approach of Mersey Care NHS FT to your organisation, consider the following questions and use your answers to reflect on and develop your organisations current approach:

* In which ways does work surrounding civility and respect feature in the systems, practices and processes of your organisation?

* How does this look like at the team, service and organisation level?

* In which ways can you see this work impacting on the inter-relations between staff members?

* If your organisation does not have a current focus around civility and respect in your systems, practices and processes, in which ways do you see this impacting on the inter-relations between staff members?

* How does this look like at the team, service and organisation level?

* In which ways could you see the work that Mersey Care Foundation Trust has developed around civility and respect adding value to your organisation and in which ways/level could this be done?

* In light of the national people plan highlighting the ambition for civility and respect for all employees, what reflections have you got from Mersey Care’s experience and what are the lessons/considerations you could apply to your own organisation as part of your overall restorative just approach?
