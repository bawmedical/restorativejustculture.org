Within every organisation is the people, talent and skills to implement a restorative just culture. All you have to do is listen to your people, your data and insights and be prepared to do whatever you need to do to implement. Its within everyone’s gift.

We recognise that regardless of sector or industry, organisations are essentially interacting and adaptive systems of actions, processes, behaviours and attitudes, where things do not always go as planned or expected. In complex environments such as healthcare, the risks associated with things not going as planned or expected becomes heightened and how we respond to incidents or events is critical to what this means for our people, the impacts to their career and lives and their ability to provide safe and continuous care.

Creating a restorative just culture is a commitment to your workforce, patients, organisation and the wider system, in which you pledge to take every opportunity to listen, act, learn, improve, support and create an environment that enables your people to be the very best they can be and to do the very best they can do.

Restorative just culture as one mechanism does not mean you are opposed to another. Responding to the ask of a restorative just culture is not at the expense of ‘inclusivity’, neither is it leadership at the expense of psychological safety. Saying we have a restorative just culture does not make your staff feel safe, it’s how you take practical actions to building that culture that charts new territory.

So what does that mean and how do we address all the different asks? How do we make the connections and relationships between them all? In other words what will help you have a line of sight to your ultimate organisational goals and help you connect all the pieces of the jigsaw together – a restorative just culture approach can embody it all and the aim of this Restorative Just Culture is the coproduction of the practical foundational steps that can help bring about this implementation. Although we consider every aspect of the organisation important in implementing a restorative just culture, to begin with, there are two extremely important areas we would like to draw your attention to that will play a critical role in the implementation of a restorative just culture in any organisation.

## People Processes and Restorative Just Cultures

People processes considers the principles and practices of restorative just cultures from a people processes and HR perspective. People processes focuses on the practicalities of managing the employee relations that unfold when an adverse event of incident has occurred or when an employee relations matter has arisen such as bullying, harassment, grievances disciplinary and many others.

This does not only include using methodologies such as The Mersey Care 4 Step Process as a framework to manage these conversations, it includes embedding the principles of civility and respect into our natural way of working and aiming for a workplace where equality and diversity ensure that no communities are seen as minorities.

Managing with people processes that are restorative does not only apply to HR professionals and practitioners, it applies to anyone who becomes part of the process of managing an employee relation whatever the cause, so this could be a ward manager, line manager, clinician, OD professionals, operational managers, board level executives and many more.

The skills of your practitioners are critical in reviewing and aligning your current people processes and polices to restorative principles, and this is where we all can learn and explore and gain new skills. How are you going to make sure that learning is disseminated and enacted within your teams and within your organisation to deploy these skills in the same way, because it is not as simple as just to say to someone just read these words and enact it, it needs to be in our everyday behaviours, attitudes, and actions.

## Organisational Design and Development and Effectiveness and Restorative Just Cultures

Organisational Design and Development and Effectiveness plays a pivotal role when implementing a restorative just culture supporting key areas such as People Process, Partnership Working and Patient Safety. A restorative just culture from this perspective aims to maximise the passion, talent and energy of the workforce and fully align it to a strategy for perfect care.

This area lends itself to supporting the work on civility and respect and why this has to be at the centre of all efforts to be restorative and at the core of all our policies and processes, particularly when these are being re-designed and/or reviewed to support and facilitate restorative processes.

In restorative just cultures OD &amp; OE functions can support the work which raises awareness and empowers staff to challenge poor behaviour and choose respect, reinforcing civility and a positive culture. In restorative just cultures OD &amp; OE functions support the changes needed in culture, structures and processes as well as the key themes for a restorative just culture such as psychological safety, team-based working, the psychological contract and co-produced values.
