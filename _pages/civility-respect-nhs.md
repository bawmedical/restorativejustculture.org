Civility and Respect has huge implications for the implementation and success of a restorative just culture in any setting. We believe that is should be at the centre of all efforts to be restorative and at the core of all our policies and processes, particularly when these are being re-designed and/or reviewed to support and facilitate restorative processes.

Collectively, we must ensure staff feel valued, supported and empowered to carry out their work. This needs to be role modelled throughout teams and organisations. Leaders at all levels, therefore, have an integral role to play in exhibiting behaviours and demonstrating values that lead to a culture of civility and respect.

We are the NHS: People Plan 2020/21 – action for us all recognised this need and committed to providing organisations with the Civility and Respect toolkit to help tackle bullying and harassment and to create a civil and respectful workplace culture.

## The NHS Civility and Respect Toolkit

The NHS Civility and Respect Toolkit provides a practical overview to thinking and action using the AIM approach of:

* **analyse**: understand the issues

* **intervene**: take action to address the issues

* **measure**: evaluate the impact of interventions

This makes underlying issues easier to analyse, plan for and intervene. Using the AIM model, the framework highlights the importance of data to understand and benchmark employee experience and the importance of engaging with employees to understand their experience, what the culture feels like, how the process makes them feel and what support they need.

There are four central themes to the NHS Civility and Respect framework which are:

* Theme 1: Data and Analysis](#theme-1-data-and-analysis)
* Theme 2: Policy and Process](#theme-2-policy-and-process)
* Theme 3: Staff Management and Support](#theme-3-staff-management-and-support)
* Theme 4: Just and Restorative Culture](#theme-4-just-and-restorative-culture)

### Theme 1: Data and Analysis

This theme explores and explains the ways in which data and analysis is about accessing, analysing, understanding and triangulating data. From a strategic point of view, good data and data analysis ensure that board, management and human resources (HR) have the knowledge they need to better understand issues and make them more visible, reinforcing organisational and individual accountability for action.  You should check this section to see examples of the types and range of data that can be used and the ways in which you can analyse and interpret this.

### Theme 2: Policy and Process

This theme explains the importance of reviewing our current policy position and establishing an approach and focus that enables providers to work in the space beyond policies and processes. Reviewing the balance between the formal and informal aspects of Dignity at Work, agreeing a strategic approach to conflict in the workplace and looking at how to move towards supporting staff in the restoration of relationships (preferably before they get

fixed in a retribution frame of mind). This theme is therefore about getting the policy balance right and supporting HR and management to develop and refine the necessary skills and competencies. You should check this section to see examples of the essential elements that should make up your restorative policies and the desired skills competencies to enable your people to develop and create policies that support the workforce.

### Theme 3: Staff Management and Support

This theme explains the ways in which staff and management support builds on the restorative approach by focusing on:

* What is available informally to support staff and managers experiencing uncivil and bullying behaviours
* Support during the formal processes
* Support for managers handling the process at both informal and formal levels.
* The health and wellbeing of all staff, recognising how incivility and bullying can affect the health of everyone involved.

You should check this section for examples of questions that will help you to identity the extent to which your organisation is set up to support their employees and how this can help to what extent they support their employees to challenge incivility and disrespect in the workplace. Critically it also suggests they identify the practical actions that can be taken by managers to enable them to shape cultures of civility and respect and the link this has to the health and wellbeing of our workforce.

### Theme 4: Just and Restorative Culture

This theme discusses the ways in which a just and restorative culture concentrates on the culture and leadership elements of organisations and how they can support organisations to grow compassion in the workplace, modelled by leaders. It also emphasises working with partners such as local union representatives, Freedom to Speak Up Guardians, employee engagement leads and health and wellbeing leads. You should check this section to understand the essential elements of compassionate leadership, systems elements thar trigger inappropriate behaviours and the learning from past behaviours and ways of doing things that enables restoration.
