# Welcome to The Restorative Just Culture Community of Practice 

This Restorative Just Culture Community of Practice brings together those people who are bound together by a genuine passion to bring about a restorative just culture in their organisation. It aims to serve as a resource and knowledge exchange for people and organisations making the shift from learning to implementation of a restorative just culture.  

As a COMMUNITY we will engage, share, support and learn with each other as we navigate our way through the restorative just culture journey. As a community of practice, we differ from other entities such as work groups and informal networks in that our focus is on the co-development of skills and the construction and exchange of knowledge in this area.  

Through PRACTICE we will share and apply the restorative frameworks, ideas, tools, information and stories as we connect and communicate with each other. We hope that by being an active member of this community you will benefit from having an arena for problem solving, find quick answers to questions, feel a sense of belonging and empowerment, find resources for implementing strategies, develop your own practitioner skills and behaviours, enhance your individual and shared learning and many more benefits that will organically evolve from all of your being part of this community.  

TOGETHER we will build synergies that will empower people with the knowledge, skills and resources to implement the changes that result in that transformative organisational culture  that will be unique to each of your organisations. Creating even the smallest shift in culture requires passion, commitment, leadership, influential champions and significant investment in the design and implementation of systems, process and policies. So as a community, lets help each other to achieve this and who know where this can take us.  

We are excited and we hope you are too... so lets get started!  

# The Restorative Just Culture Manifesto – A CALL TO ACTION 

Sign up to the Restorative Just Culture Manifesto today and help to make restorative just culture the new way of doing things in all organisations.   

The aim of this manifesto is to create a united mission, purpose and vision through as set of interconnected commitments that improve the experience and safety of all our people, enabling them to be the best that they can be.

It serves as a guide to those organisations and colleagues who want to work together within a framework that transcends current organisational boundaries and ways of working, to create a consistently compassionate, inclusive, diverse, and values-driven culture, underpinned by restorative principles and practices.

We recognise that regardless of sector or industry, organisations are essentially interacting and adaptive systems of actions, processes, behaviours and attitudes, where things do not always go as planned or expected. In complex environments such as healthcare, the risks associated with things not going as planned or expected becomes heightened and how we respond to incidents or events is critical to what this means for our people, the impacts to their career and lives and their ability to provide safe and continuous care. 

Creating a restorative just culture is a commitment to your workforce, patients, organisation and the wider system, in which you pledge to take every opportunity to listen, act, learn, improve, support and create an environment that enables your people to be the very best they can be and to do the very best they can do.  

## So what does it mean for you and us? 

All too often in healthcare and other sectors we are inundated with the latest campaign/ tool kit/ guidance to read and/or implement, which is not to say that they don’t add value and purpose in their own way. So how do you prioritise one over the other?, or stop you or your teams feeling overwhelmed with the ‘ask’.

To be clear, a restorative just culture as one mechanism does not mean you are opposed to another. Responding to the commitments of the restorative just culture manifesto is not at the expense of ‘inclusivity’, neither is it leadership at the expense of psychological safety. Saying we have a restorative just culture does not make your staff feel safe, it’s how you take practical actions to building that culture that charts new territory based on the science of human behaviour and Patient Safety II. 

So what does that mean and how do we address all the different asks? How do we make the connections and relationships between them all? In other words what will help you have a line of sight to your ultimate organisational goals and help you connect all the pieces of the jigsaw together – a restorative just culture approach can embody it all and the commitments of this manifesto offer the practical foundational steps that can help bring about this implementation.
